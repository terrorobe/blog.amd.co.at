I finally have a blog. Took quite some time.<div><br /></div><div>I already made a few stints into blog-country, starting pretty soon after having set up my first private server at my first employer, <a href="http://www.inode.at/">Inode</a>, where I started my apprenticeship training in IT.</div><div><br /></div><div>It all started back in 2001 with a manually edited, untimestamped, uncredited <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://amd.co.at/">homepage</a> (which I was told that it had a few followers back then).</div><div><br /></div><div>Some years later I started using a reduced form of <a href="http://amd.co.at/ids/index.cgi?mode=album&amp;album=/handy-pics&amp;sort=date">photo-blogging</a> with trusty old <a href="http://ids.sourceforge.net/">ids</a>, just snapping whatever strange, funny or outright hilarious things I saw in everyday life.</div><div><br /></div><div>Somewhere in spring 2008 a friend of mine showed me <a href="http://soup.io">soup.io</a>, which made publishing content prohibitively easy, but the platform also showed it's <a href="http://terrorobe.soup.io/post/3130391/On-the-state-of-linux-partitioning-tools">limits</a> pretty soon, especially when trying to publish longer or complex posts.</div><div><br /></div><div>And now, at the end of 2008, after 2 years of nagging by a <a href="http://www.ohbutitissoshiny.com/">friend</a>, <a href="http://zeha.at/blog/">Christian</a> showed me Movable Type, which looked slick, offered support for <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">sane databases</a> and as it turned out, is also pretty nice to use.</div><div><br /></div><div>Watch out <a href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=589">blogosphere</a>, here I come.</div>
