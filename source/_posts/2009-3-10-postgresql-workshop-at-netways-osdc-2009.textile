I'll be giving a workshop on "PostgreSQL":http://www.postgresql.org/ replication at the Netways Open Source Datacenter Conference in Nuremberg, Germany on 29. & 30. April 2009.

Topics will include a short introduction in the theory of data replication in "RDBMS":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDBMS context as well as giving an overview of the various replication solutions which are currently available for PostgreSQL. The hands-on part will focus on a few common scenarios with "Log Shipping":http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/interactive/warm-standby.html and "Slony-I":http://www.slony.info/ (TBD).

The workshop has only 20 slots available, so register early if you're interested.
